The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of a frontend-only replica of the AuraMax Framer website using React and TailwindCSS. The project started with scaffolding, which included ,  (initially ), , , and . An initial challenge involved a React JSX error due to an incorrect file extension ( instead of ) for the components file, which was promptly resolved.

The engineer methodically built out several key sections of the landing page, including the navigation, hero, features grid (converted to a bento grid), and the Meet AuraMax section. Throughout the development, the engineer prioritized pixel-perfect design, responsive behavior, and visual effects like gradients, animations (e.g., hero page-load animation using timed sequences and keyframes), and hover effects. All required images were sourced via the , ensuring uniqueness and thematic relevance. Content was consistently mocked from the reference site. Recent iterations focused heavily on refining the hero and Meet AuraMax sections, specifically adjusting image sizes, applying complex background gradients to text and images, and ensuring a global pure black background across the entire page. The AI engineer has consistently adhered to the monolithic frontend file approach and maintained a dark theme.

<product_requirements>
The primary product requirement is to create a pixel-perfect, frontend-only replica of the AuraMax headphone showcase landing page (https://aura-max.framer.website/). This involves meticulous replication of the original website's design, colors, visual experience, and layout hierarchy to deliver an immediate AHA MOMENT.

Specific requirements and implemented features include:
- **Design & Visuals**: Exact design replica, strategic color contrast, atmospheric gradients, visual hierarchy, consistent spacing (8px grid). The overall theme is dark mode, with a recent update to a pure flat black background across the entire page, eliminating atmospheric gradient blobs.
- **Typography System**: Replicate exact typography (currently Space Grotesk + Inter, with  for responsive text sizing), dramatic type scales (72-96px headlines, 16-18px body), varied font weights, optimal line heights, and letter-spacing adjustments.
- **Page Components**: Implementation of page components matching the exact design and incorporating hover effects. Sections include:
    - Sticky translucent navbar with updated navigation items: Features, Color, Pricing, Contact.
    - Hero section: layered AURAMAX outline text (now a responsive gradient-filled text), premium headphone image with page-load animation (starts from bottom-right, scales up, fades in to center), and a Watch Demo modal (in-app YouTube embed). Hero content layout redesigned with a centered headphone image and a horizontal info row below, with added bottom padding.
    - Meet AuraMax intro panel: Initially a card-like structure, then updated to a centered image (500x720px fixed size) with a layered linear gradient background, and left-aligned text (eyebrow, heading, full-width subheading) within a 1240px max-width container.
    - Features grid: Rebuilt into a dark-mode bento grid with specific card layouts.
    - Materials trio cards, Design & Build with style variants grid, Technical Specs, Testimonials carousel, Pricing section, FAQ (accordion-style), and Footer CTA.
- **Interactions & Animations**: Smooth scroll behavior (not yet fully implemented for new nav items), elegant loading states, subtle parallax/scroll-triggered animations, subtle text animations.
- **Data**: All data and media (images, content) are currently mocked for visual parity.
- **Images**: All images sourced via , ensuring no repeats and relevance to the dark, premium aesthetic.

- **CSS  function**: Employed for responsive typography (e.g., AURAMAX background text) and image sizing.
- ** & **: Used to apply gradients directly to text.
- **Linear Gradients**: Utilized for atmospheric effects and text/image overlays.
- **Monolithic Frontend**: All components are defined within a single  file.
- **Vision Expert Agent**: Tool for fetching relevant, high-quality images.
- **Screenshot Tool**: Used for visual verification and debugging.

<code_architecture>
The codebase follows a clear, structured approach, primarily residing within the  directory.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main React application component. It serves as the entry point for the application's overall structure, managing routes and composing different page sections.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was initially scaffolded and then heavily modified to compose the various sections of the AuraMax landing page (Hero, Meet AuraMax, Features, etc.) by importing components from .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Adhering to the monolithic frontend file approach, this file contains the definitions for *all* functional React components used throughout the application. This includes components like , , , , , , etc.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file underwent continuous and significant modifications. Key changes include:
        -   Initial creation (after  failed due to JSX import issues).
        -   Implementation of all sections: Navigation, Hero, Meet AuraMax, Features (with Bento Grid), Materials, Design & Build, Technical Specs, Testimonials, Pricing, FAQ, Footer CTA.
        -   Hero section updates: new headphone image, background AURAMAX text layering, content arrangement into a horizontal row, responsive image sizing, page-load animation sequence (headphone, info row, background text), padding adjustments.
        -   Features section updates: complete refactor to a responsive Bento Grid layout.
        -   Meet AuraMax section updates: layout changes (centered image, left-aligned text), image dimension adjustments (max-height, then fixed 500x720px), application of complex layered linear gradient background to the image, and setting up a max-width container for the section's content.
        -   Navigation bar content updates.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file contains global CSS styles, including font imports, custom utility classes, and base styles for the entire application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to import Space Grotesk and Inter fonts. A dedicated  class was added to define the complex styling (gradient, font properties) for the background AURAMAX text. Most recently, the global  background was set to  (pure black).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file was part of the initial React scaffolding and is intended for main application-level styles.
    -   **Changes Made**: Left minimal, as TailwindCSS and  drive most of the styling.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Configures Tailwind CSS, allowing for custom themes, extending utility classes, and defining breakpoints.
    -   **Changes Made**: Minor extensions for font definitions and potentially custom colors to match the design system.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Exact Typeface**: Confirming and implementing the exact font from the Framer template if desired for full fidelity.
-   **Automated Frontend Tests**: User explicitly asked if automated frontend tests should be run.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on refining the Meet AuraMax section. The most recent task involved ensuring the entire page, including the Meet AuraMax section, uses a pure flat black background (), removing any subtle atmospheric gradient blobs or residual overlays from section containers.

Specifically, the Meet AuraMax section's image was adjusted to have fixed dimensions of  and , centrally positioned within its container. This image retains the layered linear gradient background as per a previous user request. The content below the image (eyebrow, main heading, and supporting copy) is intended to be left-aligned, with the subheading spanning the full width of the section. The entire Meet AuraMax section's content will be constrained within a  of , centrally aligned on the page.

The AI engineer has identified the necessary code changes in  to implement the new layout for the  component, wrapping content in a  container, keeping the image centered, and applying  to the text block. The state of work is that these layout and alignment changes for the Meet AuraMax section are understood and confirmed, and the engineer is ready to apply them.

<optional_next_step>
Apply the confirmed changes to the Meet AuraMax section's layout, ensuring the content is within a 1240px max-width container, the image remains centered at 500x720px, and the text beneath is left-aligned.
